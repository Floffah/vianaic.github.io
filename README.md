# Introduction

**Vianaic** is a written script. It is pronounced: "*vee-ah-NAY-ick*". It is not a new language. It is a different way of writting. It can be used to write English or any of the languages that uses the 26 letters of the Latin alphabet. It is loosely based off of Arabic script and Roman letters. 

People use Vianaic for different reasons. Often it is used for journaling as a way to obfuscate the prose.

## Origin

Vianaic was created by Reddit user [u/vilhjalmurengi](https://reddit.com/u/vilhjalmurengi). It was mentioned for the first time in [this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Handwriting/comments/7x3hki/i_originally_created_this_script_its_not_a/). As a follow up to that post, the subreddit [/r/vianaic](https://reddit.com/r/vianaic) was created.

[/u/vilhjalmurengi](https://reddit.com/u/vilhjalmurengi):

> I created it about 6 or 7 years ago [~2012]. It is one of many scripts I have learned/created since I was a young boy. This particular one, Vianaic, is the one that I've kept to most strongly probably because of its ease and I just like the way it flows. I didn't have a very good reason for creating it, other than I find it to be a fun hobby/time-killer in between patient appointments at the hospital where I work as an interpreter. It's also a good way to keep things secret that I write down, for whatever reason… sometimes for things like personal journal entries. It's loosely based off of the Arabic script. And that's about it!

## V1 vs. V2

There are 2 versions of Vianaic: V1 and V2. **For the sake of simplicity: this website is about V2 for now. **.

V1 is the original version and it's the prettier of the two, with its long, swooping and low-hanging letters. V2 is the updated Vianaic which removed many of the low-hanging letters and replaced them with letters that stay at or above baseline. The purpose of this was to minimize overlapping if you intend to use Vianaic for journaling or anything which would require multiple horizontal lines of text.

## References and specifications

**Note:** One does not have to follow the reference and the specifications stricly. Because it is often used for personal writing, feel free to adapt these rules to your liking. Reddit is filled with examples of Vianaic variants.

*Notes: do not use the bottom line of the Y letter if it's not connecting to anything (at the end of a word).*

### Specifications

1. Latin characters `a` to `z` and digits `0` to `9` have an equivalent in Vianaic.
2. Some pairs of letters (called *diagraph*, like `ph`, `th`, `ng`, …) have their own character.
3. The words `The` and `And` have their own character.
4. A pair of same letters (like in `Eggs` or `Asset`) is combined into one letter followed by a double-tick character.
5. There is no capital letters.
6. Punctuation does no change.
7. Characters can have 0, 1 or 2 connecting points. Connecting characters according to these points form an uninterupted stoke. Words are made of one or multiple strokes.
8. Characters can have 2 forms, Initial or Final. Picking the right form makes the word flow better.

### Initial and Final form

Vianaic *flows*. Letters connect to give words this beautiful cursive look. To ensure the letters flow properly, many letters have 2 forms: *Initial* and *Final*. It is usually just a flipped version of the symbol (a bit like the Latin letters `d` and `b`).

*Initial* letters connect with the following letter. *Final* letters connect with previous letter. As a consequence: *Initial* letters are used at the beginning of a word, and *Final* letters are used at the end of the word.

The word `lentil` would start with a *Initial* `L` and end with a *Final* `L`.

Inside a word, it is up to the writer to use the form that connects the best. Use the form that is easier to move into from the previous symbol. For example, after a `M` it makes sense to use the Final form of letter, after a`J`, to use the Initial form.

### When to write `o` and `a`

In regular writing, we often do the `i` letter after we finished writing the whole word. Similarly, the `o` and the `a` letters, being floating characters, can be added subsequently to not interupt the stroke.

For example, in the word EAT, it's easier to write E then T in one stroke, and add the "A" in between afterward.

A Vianaic pangram (phrase composed of all the letters in the alphabet) including all combination symbols.  `ch`, `gh`, `ng`, `ph`, `sh`, `th` and `wh`. Meant for practice to aid in memorization of all letters:
